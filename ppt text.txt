Rote Learning​:
Rote Learning or  memorization of information based on repetition.​

​

The single biggest drawback of rote learning is, the implication that there is only one right answer.​

​

When rote-learning is used as the only learning technique, it stunts the development of divergent thinking skills, lead to a lack of creativity as well as sound problem-solving skills.​

​

​Evaluation System​:
Marks still continue to play the most important card in deciding the future of children and this often comes down upon students as a burdening factor.​

​

Instead of focusing the evaluation on a three-hour exam, the focus of evaluation should be classroom participation by a student, projects, communication skills​



Equal respect to all subjects​:
We continue to survive in the education system where science system topples the stream hierarchy.​

​

Students are pushed to become a machine which only goes for high-profile subjects and subjects like languages, communications, arts are looked down.​

​

Students should rather be pushed to pursue the subject that they like instead of creating differentiation between subjects.​


We continue to survive in the education system where science system topples the stream hierarchy.​

​
Personalize Education​:
Indian education needs to  realize that the absorption power of every student cannot be the same. Hence, the teaching method also cannot remain the same for every student in a class of 30.​

Personalized learning normally involves students in deciding their own learning process. This teaches the student vital skills that will serve them throughout their lives.​

​

For Example: Engaging in self-assessment helps students develop self-reflective abilities​.

Teach them purpose of education​:

Education is not always about becoming a big, rich person. It should be about humanism.​

Students must also be taught in-depth about the morals of life and inculcated with the humanistic values. They should be taught that life is much beyond money and success is not measured in money.​

If the Indian education system starts taking these points into serious consideration, we can attain the level of the best education system in the world.​
